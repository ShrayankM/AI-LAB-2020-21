# Hill Climbing (N-Queen Application Programs)

# Programs:
1) Simple-Hill Climbing
2) Steepest-Hill Climbing
3) Random-restart Hill Climbing
4) Stochastic Hill Climbing

# Description: (N-Queen Problem)
  * Place N-Queens on N * N board such that no 2 Queens attack each other.
  * Intially a random board is with N-Queens placed is given as intial state to the problem.
  * From the intial state all possible neighbors are generated by swapping Queens.
  * Depending on the stratergy the next neighbor is choosen and marked as current state, and the process continues until solution is found or no neighbor is better than current state.
  * Depending on stratergy used optimal board may be found or not.
  * <i> Heuristic used to check for better neighbors is no. of Queen collisions. </i>

# Simple-Hill Climbing:
  * In this search stratergy search continues till heuristic cost of some neighbor found is better than current state cost.
  ```bash
     while(True):
        board, board_cost = generate_solutions(initial_board, heuristic_cost)

        if board_cost < heuristic_cost:
            heuristic_cost = board_cost
            initial_board = copy.deepcopy(board)
        else:
            break
  ```
  * This stratergy can get stuck at local maxima.

# Random-restart Hill Climbing:
  * In this search stratergy search continues till the specified iterations or till goal state is achieved.
  * If non of the neighbors give a better heuristic cost than current state, random state is choosen and search begins again from that random-state.
  ```bash
    iterations = 100
    for i in range(iterations):
        while(True):
            board, board_cost = generate_solutions(initial_board, heuristic_cost)

            if board_cost < heuristic_cost:
                heuristic_cost = board_cost
                initial_board = copy.deepcopy(board)
            else:
                break
        
        if board_cost > 0.0:
            initial_board = [random.randrange(N) for _ in range(N)]
  ```

# Steepest Hill Climbing:
  * This is very similar to Simple Hill Climbing but the best neighbor among all neighbors is choosen and not the first that is better amongst all.

# Stochastic Hill Climbing:
  * This is very similar to Simple Hill Climbing but a random neighbor among all neighbors is choosen and not the first that is better amongst all. 
  * If that choosen neighbor is not better we keep choosing random-neighbor until better is found.
  ```bash
        index = random.randint(0, len(neighbours) - 1)

        if current_index == None:
            current_index = index
        
        cost = calculate_heuristic(neighbours[current_index])

        # print("Neighbours = " + str(len(neighbours)))
        while cost > current_cost:
            while index == current_index:
                index = random.randint(0, len(neighbours) - 1)
            current_index = index
            # print(current_index)
            cost = calculate_heuristic(neighbours[current_index]) 

        board = neighbours[current_index]
        current_cost = cost
        return board, current_cost
  ```

# Input - Output:
  * First board indicates intial board, and last final board and the count for total states generated.
